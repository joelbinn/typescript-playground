Typescript playground
=====================
Simple Typescript playground for experimenting with the language.

Usage
-----
The [main.ts](./main.ts) file is the main entry point.

Just fire up a terminal and start it with

```bash
npm start
```

and watch the output in the terminal.

After this you can change and add code (also importing other modules you write) and save. The compiler recompiles automatically an re-runs the code, so that you can see the result in the terminal.
